Brief Introduction about myself
I am Marcella Barasa, a Software Engineering student as from the 5th of January 2026, it has now been my mission to advocate for digital literacy among young women and girls in my community. Tech interests me a lot, the problem solving and deep work makes it worthy to learn. I cant wait to get a remote job in 2026.
